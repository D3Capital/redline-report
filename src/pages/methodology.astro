      Redline Report publishes adversarial, evidence-driven research focused on corporate governance failure,
      disclosure distortion, and incentive structures that create hidden fragility beneath reported performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not neutral observers. Our work begins from the premise that public narratives often diverge
      from underlying reality, and that complexity, omission, or selective disclosure are frequently used
      to obscure material risks.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px; color: #111827; margin: 18px 0 8px;">Research approach</h2>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 18px;">
      <li>
        We rely exclusively on publicly available information, including regulatory filings, transcripts,
        court records, corporate disclosures, and other primary-source materials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assertions are grounded in verifiable evidence. Interpretive conclusions are explicitly distinguished
        from factual claims.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where estimates or assumptions are used, they are stated clearly and conservatively.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px; color: #111827; margin: 18px 0 8px;">What we examine</h2>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 18px;">
      <li>Corporate governance structures and incentive alignment.</li>
      <li>Disclosure quality, consistency, and material omissions.</li>
      <li>Business model sustainability under realistic operating conditions.</li>
      <li>Areas where reported performance depends on aggressive assumptions or narrative framing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px; color: #111827; margin: 18px 0 8px;">What we do not do</h2>
    <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 18px;">
      <li>We do not use insider information or non-public material information.</li>
      <li>We do not provide personalized investment advice or recommendations.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or market outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px; color: #111827; margin: 18px 0 8px;">Corrections and updates</h2>
    <p>
      Research reflects our views at the time of publication. If material errors are identified,
      we will publish corrections or updates and clearly disclose revisions.
    </p>
